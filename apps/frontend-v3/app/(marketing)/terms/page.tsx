                https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/explore-available-balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool.html#pool-settings
                for more information) ("LBP") and will fluctuate during the Sale Period based on
                pool parameters, available liquidity, and demand, subject to a floor price of 0.001
                USD per Token (the "Floor Price"). The final Purchase Consideration applicable to
                your transaction will be the on-chain execution price at the time your transaction
                is confirmed. Note that settlement occurs directly between your Subscription Tokens
                Wallet and the LBP smart contract. The Token Vendor does not custody funds or Tokens
                on your behalf. Any fractional number of Tokens which you are entitled to receive
                for a confirmed purchase of Tokens (to the extent not rejected by the Token Vendor
                in accordance with these Terms), determined based on the amount of Subscription
                Tokens for such confirmed purchase at the Purchase Consideration as received at the
                Designated Account in Subscription Tokens, shall be rounded down to the nearest 1th
                decimal place of a Token. Notwithstanding the foregoing of this Paragraph 4.3, the
                Token Vendor reserves the right to adjust, in its sole and absolute discretion, the
                Purchase Consideration or the Floor Price at any time during the Sale Period.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Purchase Consideration shall be exclusive of all administrative and/or
                third-party charges and/or other transaction fees (if any) that may be incurred in
                connection with your transfer of the Purchase Consideration for your intended
                purchase of Tokens. Any such administrative and/or third-party charges and/or other
                transaction fees (if any) incurred in connection with your transfer of the Purchase
                Consideration for your intended purchase of Tokens shall be borne by you.

                "Third-Party Service") in order to participate in the Token Sale or its related
                activities. For example, you may be able to swap other accepted digital assets to
                Subscription Tokens on a peer-to-peer basis pursuant to quotes provided by third
                party Dapps such as Gluex (the "Swapper"). For the avoidance of doubt the LBP is an

                will be subject to the privacy policies, terms of use and similar policies and
                terms, and fees of the third-party providers of such Third-Party Services. In
                connection with the Swapper, you understand and agree that swap rates and prices for
                digital assets on third-party exchanges or pools are estimates only, and that they
                may change at any time. Accordingly, such prices or swap rates for digital assets
                are estimates only and may be inaccurate. The Token Vendor shall not be held liable
                for, and you hereby forever release the Token Vendor from, any losses or other
                liabilities arising from an inaccurate estimate of fees provided in connection with
                any use of any of the Swapper. You are responsible for setting slippage tolerance
                and gas parameters and for reviewing all transaction details, including without
                exception token addresses, amounts, minimum out, and deadlines, before submitting a

            <h2>ANNEX 2 - RISK FACTORS</h2>
            <p>
              You should carefully consider and evaluate each of the following risk factors and all
              other information contained in the Terms before deciding to participate in the Token
              Sale. To the best of the Token Vendor's knowledge and belief, all risk factors which
              are material to you in making an informed judgement to participate in the Token Sale
              have been set out below. If any of the following considerations, uncertainties or
              material risks develops into actual events, the business, financial position and/or
              results of operations of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group and the
              development, maintenance and level of usage of the Hyperwave Project could be
              materially and adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of Tokens (in the
              case where they are listed on a cryptocurrency exchange) could decline due to any of
              these considerations, uncertainties or material risks, and you may lose all or part of
              your Tokens.
            </p>

            <h3>RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN SALE</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>
                Purchase of products, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies / cryptographic
                tokens, from start-ups such as the Token Vendor and the Project Group involve a high
                degree of risk
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Financial and operating risks confronting start-ups are significant and the Token
              Vendor and the Project Group are not immune to these. Start-ups often experience
              unexpected problems in the areas of product development, marketing, financing, and
              general management, among others, which frequently cannot be solved.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>
                The Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may be forced to cease operations
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an
              unfavorable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies, the
              inability of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group to establish the Hyperwave
              Project or the Tokens' utility, the failure of commercial relationships, or
              intellectual property ownership challenges, the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group
              may no longer be viable to operate and the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may
              dissolve or take actions that result in a dissolution of the Token Vendor and/or the
              Project Group.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>There may be unanticipated risks arising from the Tokens</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic technology.
              In addition to the risks included herein, there are other risks associated with your
              purchase, holding and use of the Tokens, including those that the Token Vendor and/or
              the Project Group cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as
              unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein.
